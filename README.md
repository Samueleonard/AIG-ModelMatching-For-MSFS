# AIG-ModelMatching-For-MSFS
Latest version of AIG modelmatching for MSFS -  I take the pain so you don't have to.

A VMR File for vatsim usage has been included in the root folder (full credit to britishavgeek) however if you still wish to manually download for the latest version: https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching

Included is the latest AIG install for MSFS ONLY.

OFFLINE AI TRAFFIC WILL NOT WORK - all flight plans have been removed

MANUAL UPDATES

.aig manager recommended for manually updating, however I will try to keep this updated as often as possible - ideally weekly however definitely every time there is a new addition (within a few days) - manual updates suggested in case I forget to update
