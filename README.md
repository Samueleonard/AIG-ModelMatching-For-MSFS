# AIG-ModelMatching-For-MSFS
Latest version of AIG modelmatching for MSFS -  I take the pain so you don't have to.

A VMR File for vatsim usage has been included in the root folder (full credit to britishavgeek) however if you still wish to manually download for the latest version: https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching

Included is the latest AIG install for MSFS ONLY.

AI Sounds WILL NOW WORK as of 02/01/2022 - issue fixed by AIG (thank you)
AIG TRAFFIC FILES ARE NOW INCLUDED - OFFLINE TRAFFIC WILL WORK (100% success not guarenteed however initially, results are positive)

<b>INSTALL</b>

Download from - 

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vx16eZvGwip-zAkS3K0hFcRHg4I8Jet4/view?usp=sharing) for a zipped file (4.5gb download, ~35gb unzipped)

ALTERNATIVE - DO NOT USE - [Direct Github]() (~40gb)

Just drag into the community folder. If using VATSIM, the VMR file is included, it is just a case of selecting it through the 'custom rules' menu in vPilot.


MANUAL UPDATES

.aig manager recommended for manually updating, however I will try to keep this updated as often as possible - ideally weekly however definitely every time there is a new addition (within a few days) - manual updates suggested in case I forget to update
