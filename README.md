If using VATSIM, the VMR file is included, just select it through the 'custom rules' menu in vPilot.

**NEVER  DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM THE GITHUB REPO DIRECTLY - ONLY DOWNLOAD FROM THE LINK ABOVE**

## MANUAL UPDATES

I try to update this pack every time there is a significant update to AIG, so there could be weeks between updates.

However, if you want to update your install early, you can use the AIG manager tool to manually update (available [here](https://www.alpha-india.net/forums/index.php?board=247.0))

## USAGE WITH ONLINE NETWORKS (VATSIM)

This pack is mostly designed for use with online virtual traffic networks like [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/)  however it will also work for offline traffic (described below)

A VMR File for [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/) usage has been included in the folder (full permission given thanks to [BritishAvgeek](https://www.youtube.com/c/BritishAvgeek)) 

If you want to manually download the latest version, it is available [here](https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching).

To enable the VMR file, just select it through 'custom rules' in the vPilot menu like the image below.

## USAGE WITH OFFLINE TRAFFIC 

You can now use the pack as offline AI traffic, with the usage of the [AIG Traffic Controller](https://www.alpha-india.net/aigfiles/files/Software/AIG_TrafficController.zip)

*No support is given for the usage of offline traffic however from limited testing, it seems to work*

## PAYWARE MODELS

AIG has added payware models to the installer. For obvious reasons, these will not be distributed by me for free.
Any payware models that i do purchase will be removed from the pack, before it is shipped, and no payware files will be uploaded to the final download, or to the github repo.

If you do purchase a payware model for use with AIG, you will have to manually update your install using the AIG manager (described above).
