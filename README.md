This pack is mostly designed for use with online virtual traffic networks like [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/)  however it will also work for offline traffic (described below)

## USAGE WITH OFFLINE TRAFFIC 

You can now use the pack as offline AI traffic, with the usage of the [AIG Traffic Controller](https://www.alpha-india.net/aigfiles/files/Software/AIG_TrafficController.zip)
