# AIG-Model Matching-For-MSFS
## Introduction

**THIS PACK IS RARELY UPDATED AS OF MARCH 2024.** I may look at revisiting it from time to time to keep it up to date with any big AIG changes.


Below is an AIG install for MSFS ONLY EXCLUDING offline AI flight plans.
  

## <b>INSTALL</b>

Download from - 

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DBX7hqsbZ-9rOPT3XwugNYT5al6-QZQt/view?usp=sharing)  (~4gb zipped download, ~62gb unzipped)

Use an extraction tool such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) to extract and drag **ALL** 3 included folders into your community folder. 

If using VATSIM, the VMR file is included, just select it through the 'custom rules' menu in vPilot. More info is shown below.

**NEVER  DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM THE GITHUB REPO DIRECTLY - THIS WILL NOT WORK - ONLY DOWNLOAD FROM THE LINK ABOVE**

## MANUAL UPDATES

As I will rarely be updating this pack as of march 2024 you may have to use the AIG manager tool to manually update (available [here](https://www.alpha-india.net/software/))

## USAGE WITH FSLiveTrafficLiveries (FSLTL)

FSLTL is released and is available for free through the [FlyByWire Installer](https://api.flybywiresim.com/installer)

FSLTL is a similar project to AIG, aiming to provide a solution to modelmatching for online networks along with providing a tool to inject live traffic to your simulator, directly from [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/ "flightradar24")

This is a completely seperate project to AIG and is NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PACK (and will never be)

If you choose, you can use both FSLTL AND AIG together, as long as you place both VMRs in vPilot (make sure AIG is at the top so it has priority for models)
## USAGE WITH ONLINE NETWORKS (VATSIM)

This pack is mostly designed for use with online virtual traffic networks like [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/)  however it will also work for offline traffic (described below)

A VMR File for [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/) usage has been included in the folder (full permission given thanks to [BritishAvgeek](https://www.youtube.com/c/BritishAvgeek)) 

If you want to manually download the latest version, it is available [here](https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching).

To enable the VMR file, just select it through 'custom rules' in the vPilot menu.


## USAGE WITH OFFLINE TRAFFIC 
I have removed the offline flight plans from the download so they currently cannot be used for offline flying. If there is enough demand i can add them back.

## PAYWARE MODELS

AIG has added payware models to the installer. For obvious reasons, these will not be distributed by me for free.
Any payware models that i do purchase will be removed from the pack, before it is shipped, and no payware files will be uploaded to the final download, or to the github repo.

If you do purchase a payware model for use with AIG, you will have to manually update your install using the AIG manager (described above).
