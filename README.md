Latest version of AIG modelmatching for MSFS -  I take the pain so you don't have to.

A VMR File for vatsim usage has been included in the root folder (full permission granted - credit to britishavgeek) however if you still wish to manually download for the latest version: https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching

Included is the latest AIG install for MSFS ONLY.

<p>AI Sounds now work as of 02/01/2022 - issue fixed by AIG (thank you)
<p>Offline AI traffic plans are included - offline aig traffic works (you must use the aig traffic controller to inject correct (not included - available on aig website))
