**NEVER  DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM THE GITHUB - ONLY DOWNLOAD FROM THE LINK ABOVE**

## MANUAL UPDATES

I will aim to update this pack every time there is a significant update to AIG.

However, if you wish to update your install before me, you can use the AIG manager tool to manually update (available [here](https://www.alpha-india.net/forums/index.php?board=247.0))

## USAGE WITH ONLINE NETWORKS (VATSIM)

This pack is mostly designed for use with online virtual traffic networks like [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/)  however it will also work for offline traffic (described below)

A VMR File for [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/) usage has been included in the folder (full permission granted - thanks to [BritishAvgeek](https://www.youtube.com/c/BritishAvgeek)) 

If you want to manually download the latest version, it is available at:  https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching

To enable the VMR file, just select it through 'custom rules' in the vPilot menu.

## USAGE WITH OFFLINE TRAFFIC 

You can now use the pack as offline AI traffic, with the usage of the [AIG Traffic Controller](https://www.alpha-india.net/aigfiles/files/Software/AIG_TrafficController.zip)

*no support is given for the usage of offline traffic however from limited testing, all should work correctly*

## PAYWARE MODELS

AIG will be adding payware models to the installer. For obvious reasons, these will not be distributed by me for free.
Any payware models that i do purchase will be removed from the pack, before it is shipped, and no payware files will be uploaded to the final version, or to the github.

If you do purchase a payware model for use with AIG, you will have to manually update your install using the AIG manager (described above).
