# AIG-ModelMatching-For-MSFS
Latest version of AIG modelmatching for MSFS -  I take the pain so you don't have to.

A VMR File for vatsim usage has been included in the root folder (full permission granted - credit to britishavgeek) however if you still wish to manually download for the latest version: https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching

Included is the latest AIG install for MSFS ONLY.

AI Sounds WILL NOW WORK as of 02/01/2022 - issue fixed by AIG (thank you)
AIG TRAFFIC FILES ARE NOW INCLUDED - OFFLINE TRAFFIC WILL WORK (100% success not guarenteed however initially, results are positive)

Just drag into the community folder. If using VATSIM, the VMR file is included, just select it through the 'custom rules' menu in vPilot.


MANUAL UPDATES

.aig manager recommended for manually updating, however I will try to keep this updated as often as possible - ideally weekly however definitely every time there is a new addition (within a few days) - manual updates suggested in case I forget to update
