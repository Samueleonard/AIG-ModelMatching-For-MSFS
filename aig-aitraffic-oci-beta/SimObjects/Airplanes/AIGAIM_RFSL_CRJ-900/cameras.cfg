title = "Overhead Panel" ; This is descriptive only, not used by the system
guid = {4ca337db-ae88-4c5f-96ea-ddebbd2a86fe} ; Camera definition unique identifier. This GUID must be unique.
origin = Virtual Cockpit ; Every camera definition must have an origin that defines the object or point on which the camera is oriented.
momentumeffect = No ; Controls whether the camera exhibits momentum effect. This is determined by the settings in the Dynamic Head Movement section.
snappbhadjust = None ; These settings control how camera movement is handled when the camera system receives a view pan or �snap to� command.
snappbhreturn = False ; If true, camera position returns to its initial position when the snap movement command key is released.
panpbhadjust = None ; Same range of options as snappbhadjust. Always set to Swivel in KH
panpbhreturn = False ; If true, camera position returns to its initial position when the pan movement command key is released.
track = None ; External cameras have the ability to track a user or AI object. The Track parameter controls this behavior.
showaxis = FALSE ; Determines whether the axis indicator is shown.
allowzoom = TRUE ; Controls whether the camera responds to zoom commands.
initialzoom = 0.7 ; [0.0, 512.0] Sets the initial zoom.
smoothzoomtime = 2.0 ; [0.0, 30.0] The zoom time in seconds. By default, zooming in and out is �smoothed� by changing between old and new zoom levels over a small time period (5 seconds). This setting enables you to control this effect on a per-camera basis.
zoompanscalar = 1.15 ; [0.0, 100.0] Movement is scaled by dividing the ZoomPanScalar value by the zoom level.
showweather = Yes ; Determines whether weather visuals are shown.
xyzadjust = TRUE ; Controls whether the camera responds to position change commands.
showlensflare = FALSE ; Determines whether lens flare effect can be shown (based on user setting).
category = Cockpit ; Every camera definition must include a category that defines how the camera is exposed in the user interface. Categories define the view cycling behavior(S and A keys) as well as the menu structure. Some categories (AirTraffic, Runway, Multiplayer and Tower) can also be instance-based, meaning new cameras are created automatically based on the object type.
pitchpanrate = 20 ; [0.0, 100.0] Controls the rate at which pitch is changed in degrees per second.
headingpanrate = 60 ; [0.0, 100.0] Controls the rate at which heading is changed in degrees per second.
initialxyz = 0.47, -0.62, -0.4 ; All values are in meters, -500.0 to 500.0 (for each of the three). Camera XYZ position offset from the default location in meters.
initialpbh = -58.0, 0, 0 ; All values are in degrees, -90 to 90.0 (pitch), -180 to 180.0 (bank and heading). Camera pitch, bank and heading orientation offset from the default in degrees. Note that positive pitches give a downward view. Positive headings are to the right.
